the idea is to use 2 cameras linked to 2 Rpi
they will take pictures simultaneously (synchronized via serial or gpio or NTP) 
they will look for SIFT interest points individually in each Rpi/camera and pass this compressed timestamped data upstream to the PC
This will maximize the Rpi CPU power and will minimize the USB traffic overheads
The PC will reconstruct the point cloud from the stereo-matched SIFT points

If you know a student who knows this stuff and can quickly put something together - I will be happy to sponsor the effort.
There's quite a bit of math SIFT, optical flow, camera calibration, stereo belief propagation, point cloud culling and surface matching etc. but there is tonnes of opensource software.

If we can come up quickly with a stereo camera based on two Rpi, using  3D printed calibrated stereo camera - we put it on kickstarter and make our mark.

You can only plug 1 camera to the Pi unfortunately

Low latency capture... stereo vision.. 3d reconstruction ?
